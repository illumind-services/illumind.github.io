                  <h4><center>What is Mental Health?</center> </h4><br>
                  <p>
                    Had you asked me this question a few years ago, I’d have said, and I’m sorry for this, that it is something only crazy people bother with. Looking back at it, I feel that more than personal ignorance, it reflects the collective ignorance of society when it comes to this delicate matter. The whole stigma around mental health is not only trivializing mental health but is also making us take mental well-being for granted. This is why breaking the stigma and educating ourselves on mental health and its importance has become the need of the hour
                  </p>
                  <!-- <div> -->
                    <p>
                      A physically healthy person can be called healthy only if they have good mental health too. W.H.O defines mental health as, "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community". To summarise, mental health involves our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Several factors contribute to this,  including biological (e.g. genetic) factors, life experiences, and lifestyle in general. Our thinking, mood, and behavior are all shaped by our mental health and are the areas that can be severely affected when we fall mentally ill. 
                      </p><p>
                      By trying to understand what mental health is, we are in a way trying to understand what good mental health is, what it entails and how one can achieve it in life. One way in which one can appreciate what good mental health is by looking at what it is not. Poor mental health can often seem very difficult to deal with. To put it more informally, it could feel like there’s an inescapable negative self-critique within us that insists on pointing out our unworthiness. It tortures us by continually comparing our life with other people, fixates on all the things that could go conceivably wrong with our life, and is unkind to us in every imaginable way. The internalization of unhelpful thoughts, beliefs, and habits often fuels it. Alternately, mental illnesses can seem like a helplessness and difficulty to carry on with life due to the presence of diagnosable ailments like depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and paranoia among other things.
                    </p><p>
                      Several tell-tale signs can indicate poor mental health, some of which include irregular sleeping and eating patterns, pulling away from people and usual activities, having little or no motivation to do things you once enjoyed, having a very negative outlook on life, frequent mood swings, hearing voices or believing things that are not true, tendencies of self-harm, along with others.
                    </p><p>
                      Having poor mental health may feel self-consuming and often, inescapable. In most cases, it helps to be hopeful and to cling on to the most trivial reasons to carry on. A quick internet search will show you n number of ways to keep yourself mentally fit, but it is also important to understand that sometimes these methods may not be enough. Sometimes we may need to reach out for help, yes from friends and family, but sometimes also professional help. It is imperative to understand that it is nothing to be ashamed of; just as you would seek professional help for your physical ailments, you can seek help for your mental needs too and it is perfectly normal to do so. After all, it is impossible for a healthy body to keep functioning without a healthy mind. True mental health is in acceptance of how much ill-health there will be even while designing the most perfect life, in realizing that these can be overcome by a little love and patience, in understanding that seeking help is okay.
